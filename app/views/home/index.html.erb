      Creative writing is an incredibly daunting task. Whether in the form of a short-story, a novel, or even just drafting an email, facing a blank sheet of paper can be one of the most difficult and formidable challenges we confront with our minds. Writersbloc is a place to encourage you to face that challenge by publishing mini-series, or larger works in small segments.

      Publish a short, or a segment of a story here and get feedback from readers on whether they want to keep reading! If your story gets positive reviews, we will set you a deadline for when to publish your next segment, or next short in a mini-series, and the feedback cycle can continue! Otherwise, get some suggested edits, edit your passage, and it will be requeued in our list of reading material.
